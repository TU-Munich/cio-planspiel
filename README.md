## Takeaways regarding the game

* Mostly random. Do not try to find a general formula
* Just look that everyone has a computer.
* Read the manual so that you know what the relations are.

## Takeaways in general

* Do not try to implement s.th. like "CULTURE OF FAILURE". Do not say at anytime that you have made a mistake.
* Do not try to show the progress over time that you have made. Just show the start and the end value.
* The team with the best result in the game will get the best grade.
* You can hire 4000 people in one round and fire 3000 in the next round without any consequences.
* It does not matter at all if you fire people after you have finished all the projects. Just say s.th. like - "We founded a new IT company and the developers are there".

# No liability
I do not assume any liability or guarantee for anything. This is only based on my experience with the game in the winter term 2017.
